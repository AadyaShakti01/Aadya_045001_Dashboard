How does this dashboard work?
- The static dashboard is made first and is used to make a report.
- The second dashboard is made for dynamic representation of data. We have got two slicers i.e. education and marital status to adjust the graph according to these two.
- Once you select the options from both the slicers and click on the make chart button below it under the output area, you will get a whole new dashboard.
- Doing the above step again, will leave you with 2 new dashboards with respective updated settings.
